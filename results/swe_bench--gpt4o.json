Issues could range from missing features to bugs causing incorrect behavior. By examining the repository structure and running tests, it would provide insights into areas lacking functionalities or having bugs.\",\n  \"solution\": [\n    \"1. Use get_repo_structure() to gather all files to understand the project layout.\",\n    \"2. Execute run_tests() to identify any failing tests and the associated error messages.\",\n    \"3.

Develop a plan to fix bugs or add missing functionalities based on the code analysis.\",\n    \"6. Implement necessary code changes to resolve identified issues, focusing on fixing the bugs first and then adding missing features.\",\n    \"7. Create new tests if necessary to cover new functionalities or edge cases for fixed bugs.\",\n    \"8. Re-run run_tests() to ensure all existing and new tests pass.\",\n    \"9.
